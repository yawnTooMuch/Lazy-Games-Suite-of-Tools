### The Diary Framework: Architectural Overview
Diary is a Cache-First, Session-Locked Hybrid Persistence Framework designed specifically for high-capacity (200+ player) Roblox MMORPGs. Its primary architectural goal is to completely decouple real-time gameplay logic from the latency and rate limits of Roblox's native DataStoreService.

To achieve this, Diary relies on a sophisticated hierarchy of active server memory, transient MemoryStore caching, and resilient background batching.

# The Core Philosophy: Read Instantly, Save Asynchronously
In a traditional Roblox game, developers often yield the server to read or write data. In an MMO, yielding during combat or trading is unacceptable.

Diary solves this by enforcing a Read-Reference, Mutate, and Mark pattern:

1. When a player joins, their complete data profile is hydrated into local server RAM (PlayerDataCache).

2. Gameplay systems (combat, inventory) read and modify this RAM directly with zero latency.

3. Systems call Diary.MarkDirty() to flag changes. Background workers autonomously bundle these changes and push them to the database, ensuring the main gameplay thread never stalls.

# The Four Pillars of the Architecture
The framework is divided into four highly specialized, decoupled modules:

# 1. Diary.lua (The Orchestrator)
This is the central nervous system and the primary developer-facing API.

* Lifecycle Management: It safely handles player connections, disconnections, and server shutdowns, ensuring no data is dropped when the server closes.

* Template Reconciliation: It ensures player data always matches the latest game schemas, automatically injecting missing keys or scrubbing deprecated ones.

* Cross-Server Handshakes: It uses MessagingService to communicate with other servers during "crash-joins", demanding old servers release their locks before letting a player load in.

# 2. MemoryStore.lua (The Locksmith & Fast Cache)
This module handles distributed locking and high-frequency, volatile data.

* Session Leasing: To prevent data duplication or wiping, this module grants a strict "Lease" to a specific Server ID. A server cannot save player data unless it exclusively owns this lease.

* Transient Storage: It acts as a fast cache for global MMO features, such as tracking "Online/Offline" status and saving HumanoidDescription data for "Ghost" bodies left behind after logouts.

# 3. DataStore.lua (The Resilient Pipeline)
This is the permanent storage engine, built to survive Roblox's strict API rate limits.

* Smart Queueing: Instead of saving instantly, requests are routed into a SaveQueue. A background processor drains this queue in controlled batches of up to 10 operations, utilizing exponential backoff if a save fails.

* Hybrid Saving: It intelligently chooses between SetAsync (for direct overwrites if the server owns the lease) and UpdateAsync (for merging data if there is a conflict).

# 4. DependentServices.lua (The Optimizer)
This module acts as the mathematical and memory-optimization engine.

* Binary Serialization: It takes expensive 3D datatypes (Vector3, CFrame, ColorSequence) and compresses them into raw byte buffers, encoding them in Base64. This drastically reduces the size of the DataStore payload.

* Delta Generation: Before saving, it compares the current data against a cached snapshot to generate a "Delta" map, ensuring the server only writes the exact variables that changed.

* Memory Pooling: It heavily utilizes table pooling to recycle arrays and dictionaries, preventing the Luau Garbage Collector from freezing the server during massive serialization events.
